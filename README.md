# Forbes World’s Billionaires 2024 — Advanced Power BI Dashboard

This project presents an advanced analytical Power BI dashboard built on the Forbes World’s Billionaires 2024 dataset.

The dashboard is designed to separate **population analysis** from **wealth analysis** to produce deeper insights.

## 📊 Project Objective

Instead of only visualizing the data, this dashboard answers:

- Who are the billionaires? (count perspective)
- Where is the wealth concentrated? (net worth perspective)
- Which industries create more billionaires vs more wealth?
- How does distribution vary by gender, age, and wealth source?
